# The Plan
# Use her data frame and create a data frame for one county with the following columns: year, normalized corn yield (use diff), 
# average rainfall for the summer, frequency of rain during summer, and then columns with the average rainfall for two week spans 
# starting from April 1st to October 30th. Correlations can then be easily found. Using the FIPS codes, the correlations can be 
# looped to get them for every county.
